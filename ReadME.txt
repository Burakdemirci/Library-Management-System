                     Design and implement a simple library management system.
The library holds only books for users to barrow.
The management system’s users are library users and library staff. System users will log in to the system as either library users or library staff.
Library users can barrow or return books. Library staff can add a new book or remove a book from library. (Be careful for any unreasonable operation.)
Library staff can register a new library user.
Use csv files to keep records.
